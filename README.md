# Letter Frequency Comparison

## Scenario

You have a ransom note made from the clippings of a magazine. You need to determine if the ransom note was created using a specific magazine. This program will help by counting the frequency of letters in the ransom note and comparing it to the frequency of letters in the magazine. If any letter appears more times in the ransom note than in the magazine, the ransom note could not have been created from that magazine.

## How It Works

The program reads two input files: one for the ransom note and one for the magazine. It counts the frequency of each letter in both files, ignoring non-alphabetic characters and case differences. It then compares the letter counts between the two files to determine if the ransom note could have been created from the magazine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Download the program files to your computer.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the files.

### Usage

There are two ways to use this program: by prompting for file names or by providing strings directly in the command line.

#### Method 1: Prompt for File Names

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the names of two files to compare. The first prompt is for the ransom note, and the second prompt is for the magazine.

#### Method 2: Input Strings via Command Line

You can also input the ransom note and magazine content directly as strings in the command line:

```sh
python3 main.py --ransom "Give me all the money" --magazine "Wow, look at all of this money laying around"
```

### Example

```sh
python3 main.py --ransom "Give me all the money" --magazine "Wow, look at all of this money laying around"
```

Output:

```
FALSE: the ransom note was not created with this magazine.

A Mismatching Letter: 'v'
Count in Ransom Note: 1
Count in Magazine: 0
```

Note: The program stops and reports as soon as it finds the first mismatching letter, so it does not report all discrepancies. This is an area for potential expansion and improvment.

## Real-World Considerations

For a more realistic scenario, consider that a ransom note may include various font styles, sizes, and families. In such cases, a more advanced program would need to process images of the ransom note and magazine. It would compare the shapes and pixel values of the letters to determine a match. This approach would give a better chance of accurately identifying if the ransom note was created from a specific magazine.
